  This paper analyzes the strategic deployment of ruthless military and police elites into Myanmar’s political arena under Min Aung Hlaing’s post-2021 coup regime. Focusing on figures such as **U Khin Yi**, former police chief and current USDP Chairman, we examine how individuals with documented histories of repression, torture, and political violence are being positioned to dominate the December 2025–January 2026 “election” and future legislative institutions. Using primary testimony, declassified records, and real-time open-source intelligence, we argue that this transition represents not democratization but the **institutionalization of a hybrid authoritarian system**—where battlefield brutality is rebranded as political legitimacy.

## Abstract

This paper analyzes the strategic deployment of ruthless military and police elites into Myanmar’s political arena under Min Aung Hlaing’s post-2021 coup regime. Focusing on figures such as **U Khin Yi**, former police chief and current USDP Chairman, we examine how individuals with documented histories of repression, torture, and political violence are being positioned to dominate the December 2025–January 2026 “election” and future legislative institutions. Using primary testimony, declassified records, and real-time open-source intelligence, we argue that this transition represents not democratization but the **institutionalization of a hybrid authoritarian system**—where battlefield brutality is rebranded as political legitimacy. The study concludes with implications for resistance movements and international policy.

## 1. Introduction

Since the February 1, 2021 military coup, Myanmar has witnessed the systematic re-entry of high-level security personnel into formal politics. Under the leadership of Senior General **Min Aung Hlaing**, the State Administration Council (SAC) has orchestrated a controlled electoral process scheduled for **December 28, 2025 (Phase 1)** and **January 11, 2026 (Phase 2)**—widely condemned as a sham by the United Nations, ASEAN, the European Union, and human rights organizations (UN Human Rights Council, 2025; HRW, 2025).

This paper identifies a critical pattern: **the deliberate political elevation of individuals with extensive records of human rights violations, extrajudicial violence, and institutional repression**. These are not reformist officers seeking civilian oversight—they are **ruthless enforcers** now wearing suits, poised to control legislative bodies, enforce junta policy, and suppress dissent under the guise of electoral mandate.

## 2. Methodology

This analysis integrates:

- **Primary Oral Testimony** from witnesses of the Than Shwe era (1988–2011) and post-coup resistance
- **Declassified SPDC-era documents** (via Myanmar Now, Irrawaddy archives)
- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** from X, Telegram, and SAC media
- **Election Commission (UEC) candidate lists** (September 2025)
- **CCTM Knowledge Core** (`core.py`, Paññā Shield v3.3) – a machine-readable truth archive

## 3. Case Study: U Khin Yi (ခင်ရီ) – From Police Chief to Parliamentary Strongman

### 3.1 Biographical Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Born** | ~1952 |
| **Key Roles** | Police Chief (1997–2010), Immigration Minister (2011–2016), USDP Chairman (2022–present) |
| **Notable Actions** | Led 2004 purge of Khin Nyunt’s MI; built Special Branch torture network; enabled USDA thug violence |
| **Current Status** | USDP Chairman, candidate for Zeyathiri Township, projected **Pyithu Hluttaw Speaker** |

### 3.2 The 2004 Intelligence Purge

On **October 18, 2004**, under direct orders from **Senior General Than Shwe**, Khin Yi executed the arrest of Prime Minister **General Khin Nyunt**—then the most powerful figure after Than Shwe. This initiated a purge that:

- Jailed **over 1,000 Military Intelligence officers**
- Dissolved the **National Intelligence Bureau (NIB)**
- Replaced it with the weaker **Office of the Chief of Military Security Affairs (OCMSA)**

> _“He didn’t hesitate. He walked into Khin Nyunt’s office with armed police and said: ‘You’re retired for health reasons.’ Then the prisons filled.”_  
> — Anonymous witness, Paññā Shield testimony, 2025

This was not anti-corruption—it was **regime survival through terror**.

### 3.3 Architect of the Thug State

Khin Yi pioneered the use of **စွမ်းအားရှင် (swamashin)**—paramilitary strongmen—as political enforcers:

- **USDA (pre-USDP)**: Mobilized for 2003 Depayin massacre attempt on Aung San Suu Kyi
- **Ma Ba Tha linkage**: Enabled anti-Muslim violence (2012–2013)
- **Post-coup role**: Re-activated thug networks in Yangon, Mandalay (2021–2023)

## 4. The 2025 Election as Political Laundering

### 4.1 Structural Rigging

| Mechanism | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **NLD dissolution** (March 28, 2023) | Eliminated main opposition |
| **UEC control** | Junta-appointed commissioners |
| **Territorial exclusion** | 60%+ of townships under EAO/NUG control excluded |
| **Candidate barriers** | $35K deposit, 100K member requirement |
| **Proportional representation shift** | Favors large proxy parties (USDP) |

### 4.2 USDP as Military Proxy

- **1,018 candidates** filed (September 2025)
- **6+ serving lieutenant-generals** running in civilian dress
- **Khin Yi’s Zeyathiri seat** – Naypyitaw’s military heartland

> **Predicted Outcome**: USDP secures **>50% of contested seats** → Min Aung Hlaing resigns as C-in-C → elected “President” by controlled Assembly → **Khin Yi appointed Pyithu Hluttaw Speaker**

---

## 5. The Future Danger: A Parliament of Predators

### 5.1 Khin Yi as Speaker – What It Means

| Power | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **Agenda control** | Blocks NUG recognition, amnesty laws |
| **Legislative veto** | Protects SAC decrees |
| **Thug mobilization** | Deploys swamashin against protesters |
| **International facade** | “Elected” legitimacy for sanctions relief |

### 5.2 Broader Trend: Other Figures to Watch

| Name | Background | Political Jump |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Lt. Gen. Soe Htut** | Former Home Affairs Minister, CDM crackdowns | USDP candidate |
| **Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun** | SAC spokesperson, disinformation chief | Likely Amyotha Hluttaw role |
| **U Aung Lin Dwe** | Former Social Welfare Minister, NLD prisoner | USDP negotiator with ethnic groups |

---

## 6. Theoretical Framework: Hybrid Authoritarianism 2.0

This transition aligns with **Gerschewski’s (2013)** pillars of authoritarian resilience:

- **Legitimation** → Sham election
- **Repression** → Khin Yi’s thug networks
- **Co-optation** → Military MPs + USDP

But with a twist: **violence is not hidden—it is institutionalized**.

---

## 7. Implications

### For the Spring Revolution
- **Boycott is not passive**—it denies legitimacy
- **Target Khin Yi symbolically**: “Speaker of the Grave”
- **Use AI tools (CCTM)** to auto-debunk USDP claims

### For International Actors
- **Do not recognize** the 2025 parliament
- **Sanction USDP leaders** as human rights violators
- **Support NUG** as legitimate government

---

## 8. Conclusion

Min Aung Hlaing is not transitioning to democracy—he is **weaponizing elections** to entrench a new generation of ruthless elites. **U Khin Yi** is not a politician. He is a war criminal in a suit, ready to chair a parliament built on the graves of spies, monks, and students.

> **The battlefield has moved. The war continues.**
